                                    <li>Combine half of the soy sauce, rice vinegar, half of the chives, sesame seeds, and chile sauce in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
                                    <li>Mix pork, garlic, egg, the rest of the chives, the rest of soy sauce, sesame oil, and ginger in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Place a dumpling wrapper on a lightly floured work surface and spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filling in the middle. Wet the edge with a little water and crimp together forming small pleats to seal the dumpling. Repeat with remaining dumpling wrappers and filling.</li>
                                    <li>Add the coconut milk, water, and cover the pot with its lid. Let cook for about 3 minutes or until all the ingredients are cooked. Add the sugar, and stir to mix well with the curry.</li>
                                    <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place 8 to 10 dumplings in the pan and cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Pour in water, cover and cook until the dumplings are tender and the pork is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Repeat for remaining dumplings. Serve with soy sauce mixture for dipping.</li>

                                    <h3 class='fact-title'>Broccoli contains more protein than steak</h3>
                                    Former President George W Bush may have once famously proclaimed:
                                    “I’m president of the United States and I’m not going to eat any more broccoli,”
                                    but don’t listen to him! Besides the usual nutrition one gets from eating their greens,
                                    broccoli has a great deal of protein. Calorie for calorie, there is more protein in broccoli than steak.
                                    And it doesn’t come with all those saturated and trans fats or cholesterol, so you can get all the protein
                                    you need with a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular disease with this healthy food.

                                    <h3 class='fact-title'>Pistachios are actually fruits</h3>
                                    Another unbelievable-but-true random fact! They are actually the seeds of a fruit
                                    (the outer fruit is removed during processing). Like other ‘nuts’,
                                    pistachios are a rich source of protein, fibre, vitamins and minerals,
                                    which can help people with weight management, protect against diabetes
                                    and hypertension and improve digestion. The omega-3 fatty acids present
                                    in pistachios can help lower your blood pressure and may also reduce your risk of heart disease.
