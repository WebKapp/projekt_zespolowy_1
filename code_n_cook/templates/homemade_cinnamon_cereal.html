                                    <li>Preheat Your oven to 220 C. In a large bowl, stir together the almond flour, coconut flour, 3/4 cup Coconut sugar, salt and cinnamon until well mixed.</l1>
                                    <li>Add in the egg white and melted coconut oil. Using your hands, press the mixture together until it begins to moisten and you can pack it into a ball.</li>
                                    <li>Place half the dough between two large pieces of parchment paper and roll out until VERY thin, about 1/16 inch thick.</li>
                                    <li>Cut the dough into 3/4 inch squares and gently transfer to the prepared sheets. * Repeat with remaining dough **</li>
                                    <li>Sprinkle the remaining 2 tsp of Coconut sugar over the squares and bake until they just turn golden brown, about 3-4 minutes. They burn very quickly so watch them closely in that last minute. They will not be crunchy when they come out of the oven.</li>
                                    <li>Let the squares cool on the pan completely and then devour. Serve with milk of your choice. The rest of a cereal store in a sealed container (a jar for example).</li>

                                    <h3 class='fact-title'>Broccoli contains more protein than steak</h3>
                                    Former President George W Bush may have once famously proclaimed:
                                    “I’m president of the United States and I’m not going to eat any more broccoli,”
                                    but don’t listen to him! Besides the usual nutrition one gets from eating their greens,
                                    broccoli has a great deal of protein. Calorie for calorie, there is more protein in broccoli than steak.
                                    And it doesn’t come with all those saturated and trans fats or cholesterol, so you can get all the protein
                                    you need with a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular disease with this healthy food.

                                    <h3 class='fact-title'>Pistachios are actually fruits</h3>
                                    Another unbelievable-but-true random fact! They are actually the seeds of a fruit
                                    (the outer fruit is removed during processing). Like other ‘nuts’,
                                    pistachios are a rich source of protein, fibre, vitamins and minerals,
                                    which can help people with weight management, protect against diabetes
                                    and hypertension and improve digestion. The omega-3 fatty acids present
                                    in pistachios can help lower your blood pressure and may also reduce your risk of heart disease.
