                                    <li>Place the peeled potatoes in a saucepan and fill with cold water. Bring to a boil, and continue boiling until the potatoes are just barely cooked through (important!), about 20 minutes.</li>
                                    <li>Preheat the oven to 220 degrees C and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                                    <li>Grate the potato into a mixing bowl using the largest holes on your grater.</li>
                                    <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the aquafaba and sea salt with a fork. Add about half of this mixture to the grated potato and stir.</li>
                                    <li>Add the shredded Brussels sprouts to the bowl along with the rest of the aquafaba mixture (this is just to ensure the salt and aquafaba are distributed evenly), and stir to combine with the potatoes. Taste a pinch of the mixture and add more salt if desired (it won't taste great at this point because of the raw sprouts, but it's safe to eat).</li>
                                    <li>By hand, form the mixture into small balls or tater tot shapes, squeezing each one gently to compress it a little bit, and place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat until the mixture is used up. The baking sheet should be large enough that none of the tots are touching. If needed, use a second baking sheet rather than crowding the first one.</li>
                                    <li>Brush the tops of the Brussels sprout tater tots with a very light coating of olive oil. Sprinkle with additional salt if desired. Bake for 15 minutes, then very gently flip over the tater tots. Bake for another 15-20 minutes or until lightly browned and crisp.</li>

                                    <h3 class='fact-title'>Broccoli contains more protein than steak</h3>
                                    Former President George W Bush may have once famously proclaimed:
                                    “I’m president of the United States and I’m not going to eat any more broccoli,”
                                    but don’t listen to him! Besides the usual nutrition one gets from eating their greens,
                                    broccoli has a great deal of protein. Calorie for calorie, there is more protein in broccoli than steak.
                                    And it doesn’t come with all those saturated and trans fats or cholesterol, so you can get all the protein
                                    you need with a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular disease with this healthy food.

                                    <h3 class='fact-title'>Pistachios are actually fruits</h3>
                                    Another unbelievable-but-true random fact! They are actually the seeds of a fruit
                                    (the outer fruit is removed during processing). Like other ‘nuts’,
                                    pistachios are a rich source of protein, fibre, vitamins and minerals,
                                    which can help people with weight management, protect against diabetes
                                    and hypertension and improve digestion. The omega-3 fatty acids present
                                    in pistachios can help lower your blood pressure and may also reduce your risk of heart disease.
